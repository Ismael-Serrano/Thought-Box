Welcome to Thought Box. The purpose of this program is the observation of the different thoughts that
pop into our minds. When you notice that a certain idea, thought or feeling is important to you or has
crossed your mind several times, you can drop it in the box. Once inside, you can make thoughts bigger
as they happen again. You can also remove any thoughts that have become irrelevant to you.


   To enter a thought in the box, write an identification tag and what that thought consists of. 
   Click the 'Enter' button.


   To increase or decrease the size of a thought click on it, then click on the '+' or '-' buttons 
   to the right side of the box. You can also double-click on the thought to increase its size and
   double right click to reduce it.


   To remove a thought click on it and then on the 'Remove' button to the right side of the box.


   Thoughts can be modified in the control panel. Select a thought and click on the 'Edit' button. 
   Now you can rewrite or add information to a thought's tag or content. After making any change,
   click on 'Accept' to confirm the amendment.
